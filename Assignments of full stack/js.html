            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
            curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
