        <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Two days after the government announced a decision to block <b>PUBG MOBILE</b>, a wildly popular online multiplayer shooting game, along with over 100 Chinese apps amid renewed tension at the border,
            a home-grown competitor called FAU-G was unveiled by <b>Bollywood star Akshay Kumar</b>.<br><br>
            --> Being published by Bengaluru-based <b>nCore games</b> which counts Indian gaming industry veteran Vishal Gondal as an investor,<b> FAU-G</b> is short for Fearless and United-Guards and has pledged to donate
             20 per cent of its revenue to the government's fund for paramilitary forces called Bharat Ke Veer set up after the 2019 Pulwama terror attack.
            <br><br> Mr Kumar also billed the project as playing nicely with the government's push for self-reliance and indigenous enterprises launched in the wake of the coronavirus crisis dubbed "Atmanirbhar Bharat".
           <br><br>--> Many on social media noted the timing of the announcement that came close on the heels of the government's ban on PUBG MOBILE, developed by Chinese gaming and social media group <b>Tencent</b>, that ranks 
               among the world's top five smartphone games with over 700 million downloads.
            <br><br>-->"This game was in the works for some months.... In fact the first level of the game is based on <b>Galwan Valley</b>," Mr Gondal told news agency Reuters, referring the deadly <b>clash in Ladakh in June</b>t
            left <b>Indian soldiers dead</b> the Chinese also suffered an unspecified number of casualties.<b>FAU-G</b> will be launchd by the end of <b>October</b>, he said.</p>
